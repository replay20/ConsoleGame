# ConsoleGame
Hello
It's just a simple idle game which contains for now only one battle. I don't know if I will expand this, because I consider this as excercise to improve my c# skills.
I could expand this with new moves or units. If it's needed I will do this.

This is how this game works:

As first you will be asked for your name (you can type whatever you want). Then type number of unit which you would like to be on your side
(for now it's just knight and brute). After choosing your unit you will see detailed information about your choice and then you will be asked if you want to fight brute.
After confirmation you will see the course of the fight. It ends when either unit has hp lower than (or equal to) 0. Then you will get notification if you won or lost.
